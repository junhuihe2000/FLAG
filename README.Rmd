# FLAG

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FLAG is to provides algorithms to make inference
in large scale data by heat kernel Gaussian process. The fast computation
benefits from subsampling, constructing graph Laplacian through transition decomposition
and truncated SVD. Then the prior covariance matrix is approximated by 
spectral properties of heat kernel. The package also includes 
Gaussian process logistic regression with Poyla-Gamma samplers and 
Gaussian regression.

## Installation

You can install the development version of FLAG from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("junhuihe2000/FLAG")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(FLAG)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
