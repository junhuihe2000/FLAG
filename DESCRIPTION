Description: The underlying package "FLAG" provides algorithms to make inference
    in large scale data by heat kernel Gaussian process. The fast computation
    benefits from subsampling, constructing graph Laplacian through transition decomposition
    and truncated SVD. Then the prior covariance matrix is approximated by 
    spectral properties of heat kernel. The package also includes 
    Gaussian process logistic regression with Poyla-Gamma samplers and 
    Gaussian regression.
