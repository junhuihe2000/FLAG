\title{Local anchor embedding of one single point by
gradient descent projection with Nesterov's methods}
\usage{
local_anchor_embedding(x, U)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector with length d, indicates the single point to be embedded.}

\item{U}{A numeric matrix with dimension (r, d), the columns of U
are equal to the length of x, including KNN reference points.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with the length r, convex combination coefficients.
